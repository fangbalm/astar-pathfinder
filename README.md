# astar-pathfinder


## Description
A path visualizer for the [A* Search Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/a-search-algorithm/) created using Python and the [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) library. 
  

## Usage 
Run using ``` python3 pathfinder.py ```
On load, you will be brought to a grid that will allow you to set up the algorithm's visualization path. The first mouse click denotes the starting point on the grid, and the second click indicates the end point. After the start and end are established, you can then click to add various barriers between the two points. 

Pressing the spacebar activates the visualization itself, which will search for the shortest and most efficient route that exists between start and finish. Right click allows you to delete previously placed barriers. 

## Motivation 
This was a project meant to enhance my understanding of path traversal algorithms & heuristics. I aim to add a variety of other algorithm visualizations to this project in the near future. Thanks for reading!
